# mojo-midi-floppy
An implementation of a MIDI floppy controller using the Mojo dev board. This work is inspired by [Moppy](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy), and all of the other crazy folks who have made floppy drives into musical instruments. All of these projects I could find use Arduino to clock the floppies, but it seemed like an FPGA would be a better choice, so I decided to give it a try. I also want this device to be directly controlled using MIDI, without the need for any other preprocessing.
**This project is in progress!** More to come, soon.

The finished product will be displayed on my vanity site, http://www.shamlian.net/ .
